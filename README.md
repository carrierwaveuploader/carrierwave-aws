# Carrierwave AWS Storage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sorentwo/carrierwave-aws.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sorentwo/carrierwave-aws)

Use the officially supported AWS-SDK library for S3 storage rather than relying
on fog. There are several things going for it:

* Full featured, it supports more of the API than Fog
* Significantly smaller footprint
* Fewer dependencies
* Clear documentation

Here is a simple comparison table [02/04/2013]

| Library | Disk Space | Lines of Code | Boot Time | Runtime Deps | Develop Deps |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| fog     | 28.0M      | 133469        | 0.693     | 9            | 11           |
| aws-sdk | 4.4M       |  80017        | 0.098     | 3            | 8            |

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'carrierwave-aws'
```

## Usage

Configure and use it just like you would Fog. The only notable difference is
the use of `aws_bucket` instead of `fog_directory`, and `aws_acl` instead of
`fog_public`.

```ruby
CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  config.storage    = :aws
  config.aws_bucket = ENV['S3_BUCKET_NAME']
  config.aws_acl    = :public_read
  config.aws_authenticated_url_expiration = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365

  config.aws_credentials = {
    access_key_id:     ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
    secret_access_key: ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
  }
end
```

If you want to supply your own AWS configuration, put it inside `config.aws_credentials` like this:

```ruby
config.aws_credentials = {
  access_key_id:     ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
  secret_access_key: ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'],
  config: AWS.config(my_aws_options)
}
```

`AWS.config` will return `AWS::Core::Configuration` object which is used through `aws-sdk` gem. Browse
[Amazon docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSRubySDK/latest/AWS/Core/Configuration.html) for additional info. For
example, if you want to turn off SSL for your asset URLs, you could simply set `AWS.config(use_ssl: false)`.
